Load all the following library
```{r eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(broom)
library(leaps)
library(rms)
library(Sleuth3) #case1201 data
```

Load model and data
```{r eval = TRUE}
sat_scores <- Sleuth3::case1201 
full_model <- lm(SAT ~ Takers + Income + Years + Public + Expend + Rank , data = sat_scores)
tidy(full_model)
```
Exercise 1
```{r eval = TRUE}
model_select <- regsubsets(SAT ~ Takers + Income + Years + Public + Expend + 
                             Rank , data = sat_scores, method = "backward")
select_summary <- summary(model_select)
select_summary$adjr2 
coef(model_select, 1:6)
coef(model_select, 4)
```
Exercise 1
```{r}
select_summary$bic
coef(model_select, 3)
